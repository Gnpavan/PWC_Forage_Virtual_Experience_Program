# **PWC Virtual Experience Program by Forage**

## **Project Overview:**

PwC is a multinational professional services network of firms, operating under the PwC brand. It is one of the Big Four accounting firms, along with Deloitte, EY, and KPMG. With offices in 151 countries and more than 364,000 people. 

The tasks here were to analyze three datasets with different industry backdrops.
- Call Center dataset to understand the agent and customer behaviour.
- Churn dataset to understand the reason for churn and retain the customers.
- HR datset to check of diversity and inclusion.

## **Project Findings:**

Above is the dashboard I have built with the call center dataset received from the team. This case study deals with the Call Centre Trends. Here, we analyse the number of incoming calls, call agent's performance, speed of answer, call duration, trends on daily and hourly basis and customer satisfaction ratings. The dashboard defines key KPIs that impact the customer satisfaction as well as performance of the call agents. The goal is to identify opportunities where the performance can be monitored and enhanced.

-	The ratio between the number of calls received and issues resolved is very minimal which directly shows that Agents are pretty much doing their job in solving the issues.
-	Agents are quick to answer a call which is around a minute, and they just take around 3 minutes to solve an issue.
-	The average satisfaction rating for the agents is not that bad but can be improved by reducing the time in answering the call, attending all calls without abounding any.

The organisation is keen to know the possible customers who are likely to churn. In this Dashboard, we create KPIs around demographics, company service and customer profiling to know which of them have the highest chance of getting churned. The analysis depicts some key insights that will help the board member take steps in future to reduce the churning rate and increase customer loyalty.

-	Target Senior Citizen Segment, offer personalized assistance and discounts to senior citizens to increase retention.
-	Engage Single Customers, create exclusive loyalty programs for singles to strengthen their connection with the service.
-	Incentivize Longer Contracts, provide additional benefits or cost savings for customers who opt for longer than 1-year contracts.
-	Enhance Fiber Optic Internet Experience, invest in improving fibre optic infrastructure and provide faster, more reliable internet service.
-	Proactive Customer Support for Admin Tickets. Prioritize resolving admin tickets promptly to show attentive customer care.
-	Tailored Retention Offers, offer personalized retention offers based on individual customer needs and preferences.

Here, we create a dashboard on the employee participation in the organisation. We define the key KPIs like, New Hires, Promotions, Employee Exits and Employee Gender ratio to understand the situation of diversity and inclusivity in the workforce. Enabling diversity and eliminating gender-based stereotyping is key to the balanced workforce and company success.

-	The higher turnover percentage among female employees suggests that there may be factors leading to dissatisfaction or challenges specific to female employeesâ€™ experiences within the company. This could include issues related to work-life balance, workplace culture, or career advancement opportunities.
-	The observation that there are more male employees in higher-level job profiles indicates that there may be systemic barriers or a lack of support for female employees to progress into leadership positions.
-	Higher promotions of females in the Junior Officer profile but at the top level profile female promotion is lower. This may be connected to performance rating, lack of support, and training to improve performance.
